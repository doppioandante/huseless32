# huseless32

Huseless simulates an architecture based on the PD32 processor.
PD32 means *processore didattico a 32 bit* (didactic 32-bit processor) and is used in some italian universities as dummy architecture for the introductory computer architecture course.
Huseless will eventually include:
  - The actual simulator as a library
  - Assembler and linker for the PD32 assembly, targeting the ELF format
  - An actual simulator executable that interfaces with javascript in the browser.
